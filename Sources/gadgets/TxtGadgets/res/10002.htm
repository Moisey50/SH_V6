Then, under System Tools, select Device Manger and Ports (COM & LPT). Possible values: COM1: - COM8: If the device is connected to another COM (for example COM13:) change it to one of the possible values via Advanced Settings in Port Settings in Computer Management. </p><p><b>Baud Rate</b> - sets the maximum rate, in bits per second (bps), in which data can be transmitted through the selected communication port. Possible values: 110 \ 300 \ 600 \ 1200 \ 2400 \ 4800 \ 9600 \ 14.4k \ 19.2k \ 38.4k \ 56k \ 115200 \ 128k \ 256k. </p><p><b>Data Bits</b> - sets the number of data bits each transmitted\ received character occupies. Possible values: 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8. </p><p><b>Parity</b> - sets the type of error checking used in selected communication port. Note that the external device must have the same settings. Possible values: </p><ul><li>None - means that no parity bit is added to the data bits sent from selected communication port (disables error checking). </li><li>Even - means that a parity bit is set to 1 if it is needed to make the number of 1s in the data bits even (enables error checking). </li><li>Odd - means that a parity bit is set to 1 if it is needed to make the number of 1s in the data bits odd (enables error checking). </li><li>Mark - means that a parity bit is added and always set to 0. </li><li>Space - means that a parity bit is added and always set to 1. </li></ul><p><b>Stop Bits</b> - sets the time between transmitted characters (measured in bits per second). Possible values: 1 \ 1.5 \ 2. </p><p><b>DTR/DSR</b> - use\ don’t use Data Terminal Ready and Data Set Ready (signals that indicate readiness to communicate). </p><p><b>RTS/CTS</b> - use\ don’t use Data Request To Send and Clear To Send mechanism to reduce frame collisions. </p><p><b>XON/XOFF</b> - use\ don’t use XON (sometimes referred to as software handshaking, a standard software method of controlling data flow between 2 modems). </p><p><b>Wait for CR</b> – use \ don’t use Wait for Carriage Return (‘enter’ key that signals the start of new data packet).</p><p>&nbsp; </p></td></tr></table></body></html>
